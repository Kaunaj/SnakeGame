# SnakeGame
  
### Description  
  
I tried to code the snake game in Lua by following a CS50 tutorial taught by Colton Ogden.  
  
Classic version: Game over when snake collides with itself or with a white tile.  
  
Adventure version: Level goes up after every 10 red tiles consumed. Total 5 levels. Game over when snake collides with itself or with a white tile.
